<!--  %Sequential analysis methods have evolved to enhance early detection of rare vaccine-related adverse events while controlling error rates. Traditional SPRT, limited by fixed alternatives and sensitivity to relative risk, led to MaxSPRT, which allows real-time monitoring with composite alternatives using Poisson or Binomial models. CMaxSPRT improves Type I error control under sparse historical data by conditioning on observed events. Alpha spending functions further refine error control across time, and when optimised via linear programming, they minimise time to signal, balance error types, and outperform classical approaches in vaccine safety surveillance. The predictive value and power of controlling Type-I and Type-II error as well as achieving optimized Expected Time To Signal (ETS) and Expected Sample Size to signal (ESS), and the ability to monitor adverse events continuously and in a group manner have made it an emerging technique for vaccine adverse event surveillance. 
     %In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for implementing sequential analysis on various organizational settings including a generalised data wrangling technique in a spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system. 
     %We analysed the literature regarding sequential analysis. Our analysis revealed that the variations of sequential analysis could be defined in terms of the specific requirements and objectives of the users, differing types of data and purpose of use, including whether used for epidemiological surveillance or for regulatory monitoring, properties and nature of the data, type and attributes of vaccines and the adverse event following immunisation (AEFI). The variations and their scope of use make it challenging to reproduce at the organisational level. The literature has enough supporting materials, but a top-to-bottom workout for a specific settings starting from scratch such as data wrangling would increase the use of such a great and powerful sequential analysis. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive guide for organisations contemplating the implementation of sequential analysis technique from scratch and describes a generic implementation system. 
     %We offer a detailed explanation of the steps and challenges associated with the implementation of MaxSPRT on the AEFI reporting database of Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Vaccination in the Community, Victoria, Australia (SAEFVIC), the largest jurisdictional reporting service by volume in Australia. It also proposes some techniques and measures to deal with the challenges associated with the implementation process. -->    <p>Timely detection of rare adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) is critical for vaccine safety.

          <bibrefphrase>, </bibrefphrase>
        </bibref>)</cite> and Type II errors. The conventional Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT), however fundamental, has limitations due to its dependence on predetermined alternatives and sensitivity to predefined relative risks. These drawbacks are addressed by the Maximised SPRT (MaxSPRT), which supports both Poisson and Binomial models for a variety of surveillance designs and permits composite alternatives (e.g., Relative Risk, <Math mode="inline" tex="RR&gt;1" text="R * R &gt; 1" xml:id="m1">

By conditioning on observed events, the Conditional MaxSPRT (CMaxSPRT) goes one step further and maintains error validity even when there is a lack of historical data. Alpha spending functions <cite class="ltx_citemacro_citep">(<bibref bibrefs="silva2020optimal" separator=";" show="AuthorsPhrase1Year" yyseparator=",">

        </bibref>)</cite>, especially when optimised by linear programming techniques, provide better control over error rates to handle repeated testing, allowing for more effective designs with lower expected time to signal (ETS) and expected sample size (ESS).</p>
    <p>Despite these methodological breakthroughs, sequential analysis of spontaneous surveillance systems are still difficult to apply in the real world and lack standardisation. This paper proposes a practical implementation of sequential analysis in real-world settings, encompassing everything from data wrangling to signal detection. By synthesising existing literature, we identify crucial contextual factors that influence design choices, such as data structure, surveillance objectives, and vaccine-AEFI characteristics. With SAEFVIC (a system for Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Vaccination in the Community), Victoria’s jurisdictional vaccine safety system, as a case study, we outline implementation steps, talk about common issues, and provide solutions. This work acts as a guide for organisations intending to start from scratch when integrating sequential analysis into vaccine pharmacovigilance operations.</p>

      <p>Sequential analysis especially MaxSPRT is a powerful method for ongoing vaccine surveillance, offering flexibility to adapt to various situations and data limitations. However, the offered flexibility and variations as well as the lack of step-by-step guidance can lead to challenges in implementation. Our paper simplifies the MaxSPRT method with clear explanations and step-by-step guidance from scratch with illustrative computation, addressing potential issues and proposing solutions to improve its use in monitoring vaccine and drug safety.

Though relatively rare, more severe side effects may occur.

      <p>Sequential analysis for post-market surveillance evolved to enable early detection of rare adverse events while controlling error rates. An important aspect of vaccine surveillance is the continuous monitoring of adverse events that vaccinees may experience when vaccines are administered, through a continuous sequential analysis that detects a signal when adverse events exceed the probability that they occur by chance <cite class="ltx_citemacro_citep">(<bibref bibrefs="kulldorff2011maximized" separator=";" show="AuthorsPhrase1Year" yyseparator=",">

It assumes fixed alternatives and known expected event rates and is appropriate for sequentially independent and identically distributed (iid) data, which implies that the data comes from the same distribution. SPRT is used for surveillance to test if the null hypothesis (no vaccine safety signal or the vaccine is safe), is more likely than the alternative hypothesis (there is a vaccine safety signal). However, SPRT is highly sensitive to the relative risk chosen in the alternative hypothesis construction, which makes it difficult to use for ongoing, routine surveillance.</p>

They present detailed methodological insights and introduce optimized alpha spending plans to minimize the expected time to signal (ETS) and expected sample size (ESS). However, while Silva et al.’s work expertly addresses statistical optimizations, building on it, our paper takes a more practical, step-by-step approach tailored for real-world implementation, particularly highlighting common challenges such as data wrangling and preprocessing that arise in operational vaccine safety surveillance systems like SAEFVIC.</p>

      <p>We start with the difference in the calculation of the parameters for SPRT and MaxSPRT. In both Wald’s SPRT <cite class="ltx_citemacro_citep">(<bibref bibrefs="wald1992sequential" separator=";" show="AuthorsPhrase1Year" yyseparator=",">

          </bibref>)</cite>, the number of adverse events is considered to be random, while the cumulative person-time or the cumulative number of vaccinations, if the follow-up time per vaccination is uniform, is considered to be fixed. The predicted number of adverse events under the null hypothesis is then considered to be a known function of the total person-time and certain possible confounding variables like age, sex, and location. Figure <ref labelref="LABEL:fig:variationMaxSPRT"/> denotes this variation by the first branching that occurs for sequential analysis between SPRT and MaxSPRT. Note, another factor that signifies the difference is, SPRT is highly sensitive to the relative risk chosen in the alternative hypothesis and cannot deal with composite alternatives.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="S2.p3">
      <p>Based on the mode of analysis—whether cohort-based or case-based—MaxSPRT can be applied in two primary forms: Poisson MaxSPRT for cohort-based analyses and Binomial MaxSPRT for case-based or self-controlled designs. The Binomial MaxSPRT (bMaxSPRT) is suitable for self-controlled approaches in which the comparator is calculated from contemporary rather than historical data and the analysis compares the presence or absence of an event (binary outcome).</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="S2.p4">
      <p>Furthermore, the dependence and sufficiency of the comparator data lead to another branching: (i) Conditional MaxSPRT (cMaxSPRT) and (ii) unconditional/conventional MaxSPRT (we refer to it as pMaxSPRT for the sake of simplicity). For the scenario when the background information is insufficient and conditional on an event, Li et al. developed conditional MaxSPRT (cMaxSPRT) <cite class="ltx_citemacro_citep">(<bibref bibrefs="li2010conditional" separator=";" show="AuthorsPhrase1Year" yyseparator=",">

      <p>In addition to these methodological variations, Silva et al.’s introduction of optimised alpha spending plans adds a further dimension to MaxSPRT design. By distributing the Type I error across interim analyses using tailored spending functions, this approach enhances control over both Type I and Type II errors, increases statistical power and significance, and effectively reduces the expected time to signal (<Math mode="inline" tex="ETS" text="E * T * S" xml:id="S2.p5.m1">

Silva et al. further demonstrated that the analytical objective should guide the choice of alpha spending function among the three types. Concave functions, which use a larger portion of the Type I error budget at the start, are preferable for early signal detection. Although this lowers ETS, it comes at the cost of reduced statistical power. Convex expenditure functions, on the other hand, preserve statistical power in longer surveillance windows by conserving alpha for subsequent analyses, providing improved control of ESS and more stable estimation when previous data is ambiguous.</p>

In such cases, all the calculations are performed at a more granular level, and all the hyperparameters, such as the historical comparator rate, are taken based on age grouping. For example, age strata can be 5-year or 10-year age groups, or bespoke grouping according to vaccine schedule. More small-ranged grouping can also be performed to address the risk of different AESIs for different age ranges. Moreover, unlike the static binning detailed above, a dynamic binning approach of risk and AEFI-based age grouping is also possible, where all groups may not have the same interval. This could provide an option for sequential analysis. This kind of analysis has not been tried yet in the literature, to the best of our knowledge.</p>

      <p>The structure and organisation of the taxonomy depict the factors that establish the implementation variations in a hierarchical manner.

<!--  %The taxonomy outlines the hierarchical factors influencing implementation variation in sequential vaccine safety analysis. As explained in Section~“ref–sec:methods˝, the difference between SPRT and MaxSPRT starts with their varying assumptions on projected event counts and relative risk. The choice between Poisson MaxSPRT (pMaxSPRT) for cohort-based analysis and Binomial MaxSPRT (bMaxSPRT) for self-controlled or case-based settings is then determined by analytical design.  Another way that pMaxSPRT differs from its conditional form (cMaxSPRT) is the availability of background data. Then, dynamic Type I and II error control is made possible by Silva et al.’s alpha spending functions, which add another level of variation.  Using linear, concave, or convex functions, these techniques optimise sample size (ESS) and anticipated time to signal (ETS) by varying alpha allocation over time.  Convex functions increase power and stability in the face of uncertainty, whereas concave functions encourage early detection. This structure captures both methodological distinctions and practical factors shaping implementation in diverse surveillance contexts. -->    <para xml:id="S3.p3">
      <p><!--  %The taxonomy outlines the hierarchical factors influencing implementation variation in sequential vaccine safety analysis. -->As explained in Section <ref labelref="LABEL:sec:methods"/>, SPRT differs from MaxSPRT due to the nature of relative risk; Poisson MaxSPRT and Binomial MaxSPRT (bMaxSPRT) are the results of choosing between cohort-based and case-based analysis, respectively. The usage of either conditional (cMaxSPRT) or unconditional (pMaxSPRT) models is further determined by the availability and dependability of background data. Another layer of diversity is added by the choice to use alpha spending and the choice of suitable spending functions depending on the goal, such as optimising anticipated time to signal (ETS) or expected sample size (ESS). All of these factors are included in the taxonomy.</p>

        <p>Like other real-world datasets, our data includes missing values, too. This needs special attention before the data can be used for analysis. Data are collected through an online interactive form that is used by end-users (reporters). Hence, it is prone to errors like human errors that include misspellings and typographical errors. This implies that we need to use some mechanism to deal with unclean data.</p>

          <p><!--  %The length of exposure is used to estimate the expected number of events in some variations of sequential analyses. -->The length of exposure is roughly the cumulative count of exposed time per vaccinee after a dose is administered and until the reaction is set on them in the person-time unit. Definition <ref labelref="LABEL:OexposedPersonTime"/> (Appendix <ref labelref="LABEL:sec:Terminology"/>, Terminology) expresses a way of capturing the overall length of exposure for all vaccinee under consideration for a MaxSPRT analysis when dose administration information is not available at all, or at least not during the analysis in real-time.</p>

          <p>AEFIs are not reported in real-time for various reasons. Even after being reported, AEFI recording may also be delayed. This phenomenon is known as observation delay. Due to such delays, at the time of analysis, the amount of the observed data for a particular study week is likely to be less than the actual amount. This leads to an overestimation of the expected number of events, which imposes a potential risk of missing a signal. To address the issue, we can adopt an approximation technique, and this is known as calculating the proportion of data complete (the ratio of the observed and expected amount of data). We defined the term in Definition <ref labelref="LABEL:defn:proportionDataComplete"/>.</p>

Although it looks quite straightforward to calculate this value from the ratios of reports obtained and expected, when we tried to apply the method we ended up with several possible ways of calculating the value.

          <p>The expected number of events is the number of events expected to be observed without rejecting the null hypothesis. Calculating expected number of events is crucial and can be achieved in various ways. It depends on the available information, objective and type of the sequential analysis being performed. There is a significant difference in calculating or estimating this value based on the available information. An approach to estimate this measure is proposed in <cite class="ltx_citemacro_citep">(<bibref bibrefs="FDAMaxSPRT2021" separator=";" show="AuthorsPhrase1Year" yyseparator=",">

Note that the count of reports for each week with corresponding report submission weeks. The table contains the distribution of AEFI reporting with certain delays. As an example, it is expected that there will be 6 reports for week 3 and those were reported in weeks 3, 5, 6, and 7. Similarly, 25 reports of weeks 4, and 5 were reported in week 4, 10 on week 5, 5 on week 6, 2 on week 7, and 1 on each of week 9, 10, and after 10 weeks.</p>

            </Math>, we need to know the total number of reports for the week. This ratio can be estimated from historical data. That means, it is quite challenging to get the ratio in case the historical information is not available or insufficient. Estimating the ratio without a proper or exact denominator of the ratio from past data needs an approximation technique.</p>

          <p><!--  %**** main.tex Line 500 **** -->One of the approximation techniques would be to take the total reports found so far as a denominator to compute the ratio. However, this technique would not be sufficient to approximate the ratio properly. Because, as shown in Table <ref labelref="LABEL:table:demonstrationOfDelayInReporting"/>, it is quite possible that we have more information about earlier weeks and less information regarding later weeks. However, the ratio indicates a wrong proportion of data complete, that is, more for later weeks and less for earlier weeks, unlike a real scenario. In such cases, earlier week ratios will be more accurate than the later weeks. We can estimate the ratios of later weeks from the earlier weeks to deal with this challenge.</p>

<!--  %At this stage, let’s demonstrate the detection of the presence of any signal in a dataset. As shown in Table~“ref–table:DemonstrationOfSignalDetection˝, the cumulative $Y˙–t˝$ and $LLR˙–t˝$ for study week, $t=9$ of the data is, respectively, 301 and 5.34 where $CV˙–LLR˙–“mu˙–9˝˝˝ = 4.11$ for $“mu˙–9˝ = 247.8$ (obtained from~“citep[Table 1]–kulldorff2011maximized˝ and not shown in Table~“ref–table:DemonstrationOfSignalDetection˝) and $CV˙–Y˙–9˝˝ = 301$ (obtained from Poisson MaxSPRT analysis using R Sequential package~“citep–rSequential˝ with a sample size = 500, total $“alpha = 0.05$ with 10 installments for 10 tests, each test having $“alpha = 0.005$, $“rho = 0.5$, the minimum number of events = 1). Hence, MaxSPRT indicates a signal in the week, $t=9$, with a 98“% likelihood that the vaccine is causing abdominal pain. “added–THIS WHOLE PART NEEDS CAREFUL CHECK AND CORRECTION OR EXPLANATION FOLLOWING THE LITERATURE, STANDARD AND THE REVIEW.˝ -->        <para xml:id="S3.SS2.SSS9.p2">
          <p>In this study, we choose the alpha spending method to demonstrate the sequential analysis, as this is the most vibrant method, providing more controls to analysts and, through additional challenges at the same time, including decisions to choose the right plan and understanding their consequences. It has a significant difference from plain MaxSPRT without any alpha spending plan. Although both approaches are used for sequential signal detection, they differ fundamentally in how statistical significance is evaluated over time. MaxSPRT employs a fixed critical value (CV) derived from a likelihood ratio test to control the overall Type I error rate, resulting in high efficiency but a rigid implementation. In contrast, the alpha spending approach distributes the overall alpha (Type I error budget) across interim analyses, using a time-varying critical value determined by a pre-specified spending function.</p>

      <p>In the previous sections, we introduced the variations of sequential analysis implementation, the reasons and the factors behind the variations, the challenges associated with particular variations, and how to deal with them. We also explain how we implemented it with maximum flexibility to offer as many variations as possible while minimising editing to the underlying code. Our current implementation, however, does not include as yet all possible variations of sequential analysis, however, our Object-Oriented code can be easily extended with new variations, functionalities, and parameters without breaking any working code or module. This extensibility offers the opportunity to add new variations and devise more effective and adaptable signal detection. Some additional potential variations that can be added are as discussed in Appendix <ref labelref="LABEL:AdditionalVariation"/>.</p>

This requires some standards of comparison, and our initial plan is to apply all the variations of sequential analysis and all other statistical methods under consideration on the same data sample. We can then compare sequential analysis variations in their capacity to detect signals under particular circumstances. Among the methods that can detect signals, we can rank them based on the time required to detect a signal. We can also check if the generated signal is a false alarm or not, by checking the results among the methods. This develops another way of evaluating the capability of the methods in signal detection. We can then perform the analysis of effectiveness among the methods by calculating precision and recall.</p>

        <p>Before we started the implementation of MaxSPRT, we faced a number of challenges. The first challenge was establishing a clear understanding of the procedure, terms, and underlying mathematics due to its many variations. The variations depend on the availability, nature, and properties of the data in hand. In addition, there is no hard and fast rule or specified model for the implementation. Organisations have different capabilities and limitations that direct implementers towards different variations, as explained in Section <ref labelref="LABEL:sec:introduction"/>.</p>

Choosing and using the right version of sequential analysis adds to the complexity. To deal with all of these challenges, we implemented the framework in a way that allows the end user to exhibit different variations of sequential analysis for analysis using some arguments, and adjustment or changes to their values.

    <para xml:id="S5.p1">
      <p>MaxSPRT is a complex but powerful method for sequential group and continuous surveillance. It provides flexibility for implementing in different situations and conducting surveillance with various data limitations. However, its flexibility comes with implementation and operational trade-offs. The associated challenges can make it difficult to implement in some contexts or organisations, which can prevent benefits from being realised.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="S5.p2">
      <p>In this paper, we explained the variations; factors behind the variations; parameters associated with different variations; potential ways of calculating parameters; challenges in calculating parameters; and consequences of using and not using various parameters. We also provided a step-by-step implementation description; demonstrating the corresponding output of each step. The step-by-step discussion also included a detailed description of our data, handling and pre-processing of the data, and our working environments.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="S5.p3">
      <p>This paper explained the MaxSPRT surveillance method in a new, different, clear, and intuitive way, aiming to support its reproduction by providing mathematical and scientific notations and definitions of the relevant terms that mitigate the gaps between concept and reality. We included a flowchart of the overall implementation method for different variations of sequential analysis; and also added a hierarchy of the variations to demonstrate the evolution of the methods.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="S5.p4">
      <p>Furthermore, we proposed new measures to assist in the calculation of some parameters. In case there are any special attributes or some missing attributes in our data, we showed in a detailed manner how to deal with the issues and proposed appropriate workarounds as a guideline for reproduction.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="S5.p5">
      <p>We discussed further variations of sequential analysis that may better capture a signal and our plan to extend the work, aiming to provide greater support to the vaccine safety surveillance community and to the public health surveillance community more broadly. We intend to further the work with the empirical outcomes of the variations of sequential analysis and other surveillance techniques.</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="S5.p6">
      <p>Our paper provides a clear road map for future researchers and pharmacovigilance practitioners to implement MaxSPRT not only for vaccine safety surveillance but also for broader adverse drug event sequential analysis and safety monitoring.</p>

      <p>AESIs may not be promptly reported in real time due to various factors. Even when reported, there can be delays in recording AEFI cases, a phenomenon referred to as observation delay. These delays result in a reduced amount of observed data compared to the actual amount during analysis, potentially leading to an underestimation of expected event numbers and a risk of missing signals. To mitigate this issue, cMaxSPRT incorporates an approximation technique involving the calculation of the proportion of complete data (the ratio of observed to expected data). This concept is defined in the following Definition <ref labelref="LABEL:defn:proportionDataComplete"/>.</p>

    <para xml:id="A1.p24">
      <p>Depending on whether an alpha spending plan is employed, there are two techniques to establish critical values (CVs) in sequential analysis. The CV stays constant during the whole surveeillance period in the absence of an alpha spending plans, providing a steady threshold for signal identification. Using an alpha spending plan, on the other hand, makes the CV dynamic, changing at every analysis point according to the amount of Type I error spent. More flexible and effective monitoring is made possible by this method, which preserves overall Type I error control across several data analyses while allowing for earlier signal discovery.</p>

      <p>In this paper, we offer a detailed explanation of the steps and challenges associated with the implementation of MaxSPRT on SAEFVIC’s reporting database. SAEFVIC is the jurisdictional vaccine safety surveillance service of Victoria, Australia. Its AEFI and AESI reporting database <cite class="ltx_citemacro_citep">(<bibref bibrefs="clothier2011surveillance" separator=";" show="AuthorsPhrase1Year" yyseparator=",">
            <bibrefphrase>, </bibrefphrase>
          </bibref>)</cite> does not currently possess dose administration information. Dose administration data is collected from the Australian Immunisation Register. At the time of writing, SAEFVIC only had access to COVID-19 vaccines, in near real-time. Hence, the denominator of the MaxSPRT calculation - the expected number of events - requires estimation or conditioning to deal with its associated uncertainty. Therefore, in our implementation, we use the concept of cMaxSPRT, similar to the approach adopted by the US CDC <cite class="ltx_citemacro_citep">(<bibref bibrefs="FDAMaxSPRT2021" separator=";" show="AuthorsPhrase1Year" yyseparator=",">
            <bibrefphrase>, </bibrefphrase>
          </bibref>)</cite> for surveillance of COVID-19 vaccine safety using insurance claim data. In both cases, the denominator is not known in real-time and at least not during the analysis. Being able to use a statistical method e.g. MaxSPRT in the absence of dose distributed denominator is therefore a practical advantage for spontaneous reporting systems to function as stand-alone signal detection systems.</p>

        <p>SAEFVIC data are prepared prior to processing. The pre-processing involves de-identification, noise handling, and missing data management. We have used the features of the MaxSPRT framework to deal with the pre-preprocessing challenges, especially, the missing data management. We allow analysers to opt-in methods to fill in missing values with some appropriate alternative values or simply discard the rows/records with missing values.</p>

        <p>To justify filling in missing values, which is questionable from the point of view of epidemiology, this is logical from a data analysis perspective in certain scenarios. As an example, if we discard the records for some missing values in gender but the gender-specific stratification is not required in the calculation or analysis, then removing that record is not worthwhile. Rather, discarding the value adds bias to the numerator and denominator calculations. However, it is up to the user of the framework to decide whether to use the filling-in method or not.</p>

        <p><!--  %**** main.tex Line 975 **** -->We first de-identify the data to preserve the privacy of the reporters and vaccinees. In the framework, we allow for the de-identification of the data, which is quite straightforward, by removing all demographics and identifiable information about the vaccine and the reporter. The analyser can also mention if any further information needs to be removed for the de-identification other than the demographics. In the de-identification process, we assign a unique identifier to each report for record-keeping purposes. We keep the columns as specified in Table <ref labelref="LABEL:table:sampleDataDemonstration"/>.</p>

        <p>Next, we dealt with noisy data. We treat noisy data in a special manner by initially considering them as missing values. In this paper, noisy data are defined as values or inputs susceptible to error due to human and system error. First, we run a routine data cleaning for logic consistency, missing values, and filtering process, where any value that is beyond the range and domain of the corresponding data attribute is identified as noisy data. We first replaced a noisy value with missing values. Then treated them the same way as missing values.</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="A2.SS1.p5">
        <p>In the third preprocessing step, we dealt with missing values. A common practice of dealing with missing values in data processing is to delete rows with noisy or missing values. However, in the case of vaccine safety surveillance, every report is important, so it is necessary to manage, instead of removing, missing records. We needed to carefully deal with missing records and use effective ways to fill them in. Of course, fill-in methods sometimes affect some important properties of the data such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance of the data. Therefore, the choice of the right fill-in method that has the least negative impact on the data is essential. Nevertheless, we leave it to the analyser to use fill-in, discard the record, or use any specific way of dealing with the missing and noisy data. In case, the analyser chooses to fill in missing values, then one of the following could be used: (i) default value/s, (ii) data-type specific alternative value, (iii) the analyser provided alternative values, or (iv) a method to get appropriate alternative values provided by the analyser.</p>

        <p>To the best of our knowledge, there is no best or single approach to dealing with missing values. Hence, in our framework, we allowed several methods to fill in missing values. An end user of the framework can opt into a specific method through parameterisation if they want to override the default one in their MaxSPRT analysis. Moreover, our data processing unit is capable of accepting new methods of filling in the missing values. The methods integrated into the current implementation that are used to fill in missing values in our data are actually the available methods in the Python Pandas package for fill-in such as “replace” with mean, median, mode, or some specific value like zero; and “interpolate” which also comes with a handful of options<note mark="1" role="footnote" xml:id="footnote1"><tags>

        <p>To explain the preprocessing process on our data, the following steps are taken. As an example, for different columns, we have used different default fill-in methods for illustration purposes. For missing “Age” and “TTO” values, we used linear interpolation as default. For “Sex” attribute, the missing values can be either replaced by randomly chosen value between “M” and “F” or as per the AESI we can decide if bias for a particular “Sex” is to be considered. By bias, we mean, some AESIs are more common or only for one sex (male or female) in comparison to the other. For treating missing values of “Time to vaccine”, “Reporting time” and “Submission time”, we converted the times to double precision real numbers and then applied linear interpolation. However, this part is quite tricky and crucial, as these values will be used extensively in calculating most of the important terms in MaxSPRT. Also, there is an inherent order of the three values by definition, and the order is <Math mode="inline" tex="Time" text="T * i * m * e" xml:id="A2.SS1.p7.m1">

        <p>To perform age-based and sex-based MaxSPRT analysis, we use age and sex columns. However, age-based analysis requires binning (or grouping or stratification of ages). We considered stratification as a preprocessing step. Here, we added a column to the data, “Age-Strata” having nine different strata, namely 0–9, 10–19, 20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, 80+. This grouping can be done on more granular levels and also in a dynamic way rather than the static grouping as shown here. The alternative ways of age grouping also added variations to the analysis, as we mentioned before. Hence, we kept the scope to feed in new binning techniques as well as new or different age strata in our system.</p>

        <p>We performed age-based stratification of the whole MaxSPRT analysis. Hence, this parameter offers another layer of computation where the rates vary for different age groups. In the case of no age-based stratification, we assumed a single and common rate for all age groups. This allows for facilitating the use of age groups and avoiding the age groups without any major reworking in the implementation, especially in the other modules of the implementation that are developed to allow age grouping in mind. Note that in cases of age grouping, all the calculations are performed at a more granular level and all the parameters used, including this one, are taken/calculated based on the age ranges of the groups.</p>

However, for brevity and simplicity, this paper uses a single and general value for the parameter.</p>

        <p><!--  %summary% -->After the preprocessing of data, we started calculating the metrics that are required to perform MaxSPRT analysis and detect signals. The analysis is required to be performed in a well-defined frame of weeks for the sake of tracking the computation and facilitating weekly analysis. As a next step, we need a set of continuous windows in the analysis, where the data is divided into different windows of weeks based on their occurrence dates. Our implementation does not rely on any explicit length of the analysis or size of the data frame, or count of windows in the data frame. Moreover, our current implementation allows the analysers or epidemiologists to set their preferred start date, end date, length of analysis or count of windows in the frame.</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="A2.SS2.p2">
        <p>In this task, the main challenge was to take the starting date of the first week. Then the formation of the windows was quite straightforward. The first window was formed by adding 7 days to the start date of the analysis. This gives us another date. Hence, our windows are defined by the start and end date of the week (does not matter what day of the week it is). Then, adding 1 to the last date of the first week gives us the first date of the second week. We make a set of windows each of 7 days or 1 week long by continuously following the steps. A point worth noting is that the start date of analysis is by default taken from the data by finding the earliest vaccination date. This can also be replaced by the earliest report date or report submission date. On the other hand, the frame ends with a week having an end date that is not later than six days from the latest date of reporting found in the data. Hence, our implementation does not rely on any explicit length of the analysis, the size of the data frame, or the count of windows in the data frame. Moreover, our current implementation allows analysts or epidemiologists to set their preferred start date, end date, length of analysis, or count of windows in the frame.</p>

The Sequential R package provides a powerful framework for implementing sequential analysis through defining essential design parameters such as Type I and II error rates, surveillance length, and statistical power. It enables users to define a concave, convex, or linear alpha spending function that dynamically distributes the Type I error among several looks and automatically modifies decision thresholds in response to progress tracking. This adjustment reduces false positives while assisting in the earliest possible signal detection. In order to ensure effective surveillance design, the program additionally computes and optimises Expected Time to Signal (ETS) and Expected Sample Size (ESS). Combining these components improves overall statistical power in continuous or group sequential vaccine safety monitoring and allows for flexible adjustment of significance thresholds.

      <p>In order to provide repeatable and expandable vaccination safety monitoring, we used the R Sequential package to create our sequential analysis architecture. Numerous techniques are supported by the implementation, such as binomial-type sequential testing, Poisson-based alpha spending approaches, MaxSPRT, and cMaxSPRT. Our method is intended to be schema-flexible and generalised, reducing rigid data dependencies and facilitating interoperability across various datasets and surveillance contexts.</p>

      <p>Table X (see Figure) provides a summary of the SAEFVIC database design, which serves as the basis for the underlying data structure used for the sequential analysis. Our implementation only needs a limited number of fields to work properly, even if the whole schema includes extensive metadata such as vaccine identities, vaccination and reporting timestamps, demographic information, and thorough reaction descriptions. To be more precise, any dataset that contains the following fields is adequate for doing reliable sequential analysis:</p>

      <p>Because of this generalisation, the system can be used in a variety of ways, including when complete clinical or demographic data is not available, as is frequently the situation in post-market vaccine surveillance across jurisdictions. The code is modular, enabling customisation of event definitions, stratification, and filtering to meet various surveillance objectives. It is also flexible with respect to input formats—for instance, gender can be represented as Male/Female/Others, 0/1/2, or M/F/O, and if Date of Birth is provided instead of age, the system adjusts calculations accordingly.</p>
